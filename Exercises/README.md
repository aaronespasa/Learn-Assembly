# Assembly Exercises

## My workflow to create an Assembly

1. Write the program in a high-level language (C++ or Python, for example). Doing this you'll be able to figure out how the Assembly code structure should be.

2. Translate the program written in a high-level language into Assembly. I like using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the extensions [x86 and x86_64 Assembly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=13xforever.language-x86-64-assembly) and [Better MIPS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vasilescur.better-mips).

3. Once you've finished, copy it on the [CreatorSim website](https://creatorsim.github.io/creator/) and simulate it.

4. Simulate your code and see how the executions goes by looking at the values of the registers at each step. Change your code when necessary.
