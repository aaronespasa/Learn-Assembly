## What is the MIPS-32 Architecture?

It's a microprocessor where the size of the memory addresses is 32 bits. This implies two things:

- The maximum amount of addressable memory is 4GB. That's because `2^32 = 2^2 * 2^30 = 4 GB`.
- Each register has 32 bits = 4 bytes (32 / 8) = 1 word.

It has two coprocessors:

- **Coprocessor 0** (CPU): Processes natural numbers, branches, loops, etc.
- **Coprocessor 1** (FPU): Deals with float point numbers (think of it as the calculator).



## My Notes

I attach the notes I took during the Assembly classes at my university. All the slides I included belong to the UC3M:

## Exercises

I really recommend watching the video about the comparison of two arrays on YouTube. You'll understand Assembly (basic execution, loops, etc.) more easily:

In the Exercises folder you will find all the instructions to test the exercises. Click on the following link to see all the exercises:

## How to simulate your Assembly code

I really recommend trying CreatorSim to test your code. It's a tool created by the UC3M to simulate your code step by step and seeing how the registers change at each step:
